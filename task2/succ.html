                        Succulents are plants that have telltale fleshy leaves containing sap. The reason that they have those leaves is so they hold as much moisture as possible. Where they are found in desert areas, but can be found in multiple places around the globe.
                        
                        Succulents cover a wide variety of types of plants. Aloe plants, cacti and even orchids can be considered succulents. ZZ plants and other common indoor plants are usually in the succulent family. They are popular because they are relatively low maintenance, require little watering or pruning and some species need very little light to thrive.
                        Succulents originally came from dry, arid areas such as deserts. There are also some succulents, such as orchids, that do get rainfall, but they grow in branches or areas where the rain might not reach them so easily. Many succulents come from Africa and other areas that have long dry seasons and where plants have evolved ways of more effectively and efficiently storing and using water.    
                        Succulents have been around for a long time, of course, and have been used as office plants and in indoor gardens for a long time. However, in recent years their popularity seems to have grown.
